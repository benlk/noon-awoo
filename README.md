# Noon Awoo Bot

This is a Bluesky bot powered by GitHub Actions.

The avatar of this bot is Brutus Buckeye, in the style of Shoko Komi. He can only go awoo if the weather is good. He wants to go awoo.

## Explaining the joke.

- Noon awoo — On Wednesdays, at noon, the [Franklin County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency tests its tornado sirens](https://fcemhs.org/Warning). [These sirens make a 'woooooo' noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8nv6eM8WOs), reminiscent of the old motor-driven klaxons. The "awoo" has become a bit of a local meme.

- "No awoo" — https://www.reddit.com/r/furry/comments/5xz25l/im_out_of_the_loop_whats_the_deal_with_no_awoo/
- "She wants to go awoo" — [This artwork of Shoko Komi](https://x.com/moiwool/status/1131382320030572550) from the manga and anime series _[Komi Can't Communicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komi_Can't_Communicate)_, about a person who struggles with speaking due to intense social anxiety.
- [Brutus Buckeye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutus_Buckeye) — Charismatic mascot of the Buckeyes, a sports franchise located in the City of Columbus, in Franklin County, Ohio.
- The weekly tornado siren test is canceled in Franklin County if the weather is bad enough that there might be confusion over whether the siren is a test or a coincidental noontime tornado.
